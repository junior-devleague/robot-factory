# Robot Objects

## Story
A factory deep, deep in the jungles of Hawaii contains the prototypes for the strongest, fastest, and smartest robots in the entire world! And you, as a Junior DevLeague Developer, are one of the only people that can understand the language of these robots!

## Your Mission
Use your knowledge of Javascript to create an object prototype of these robots and use the object constructor function to clone as many awesome robots as possible! 

## Requirements

1. Create an object prototype called **BestRobotEver** using an object constructor function 
  * Set the parameters as _idNumber_, _name_, _intelligenceLevel_, _superPower_, _speed_, _battlePhrase_.

2. Create the key values of the object prototype using **this** and set their values to the parameter values
    + `this.id = id;`

3. Create an object prototype for three types of robots and pass information, to make them the best robots ever, as the parameters.
    + `var strongestRobot = new BestRobotEver(1, "Super Strong!", 100000000, "Can cut cake with a karate kick!", 100000, "I AM AWESOME");`

4. Create a function called **printInformation**, set the parameter as the created robot variable, and return the information of the robot.

5. Call the function **printInformation** as many times as you can before time runs out!
